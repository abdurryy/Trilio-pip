Trilio - A blockchain written in Python

Point of development

Even though I don't know much about blockchain technology or how it works at all, I've decided to create my own blockchain with consensus algorithm Proof-of-Stake (PoS). I've lately been working with Solidity and been learning about smart-contract development, and during I found it quite fun and interesting. That is why this has and is a very fun project to work on, and even though it might not be classed as a blockchain I've learned a lot during research and improved my Python skills a lot!

How does Trilio work

Trilio is a fast single-threaded PoS aimed blockchain that is built upon using classes to store memory variables and detailed architectures/models.
It has plenty of features but I'd rather call them integrated smart-contracts/smart-contract actions, which include:

`Token transfers`
`Asset trading`
`Asset minting`
`Collection creation`

How to use Trilio
